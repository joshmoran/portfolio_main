        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>This project has been a challenge and have taught me to learn, revise and expenses my knowledge in certain areas of CSS, such as media queries. So, there is still some work to be made before it can be close to the one CodeAcademy employs on their landing page. It has been a challenging task to develop, but it has helped me to review weaker areas and grow and expand them. I really had fun with this task.
