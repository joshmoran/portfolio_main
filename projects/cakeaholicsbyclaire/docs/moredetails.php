        <h2>CakeAHolics By Claire</h2>
        <span><em>A website design for a potential client</em></span>

        <h3>Reasons for this project</h3>
        <p>A client has asked me to develop a website for their business to help them promote themselves in the area and help them to reach new customers to develop and expand their business.</p>

        <h3>Specifications and Requirements</h3>
        <p>The client wanted a simple website design, where clients can see basic information, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A simple landing page</li>
            <li>A simple overview of their products</li>
            <li>Contact</li>
            <li>About</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The client also wanted their social media integrated into the footer of the website, so users can see the latest news and updates</p>


        <h3>Outcomes</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, after a small time developing this project, the client decided to leave creating a website for their business. I enjoyed this project as being a being a little different than due to communicating with a clients their own needs and requirements for their business. The client was happy for me to use the initial start of the design to use on my portfolio</p>
