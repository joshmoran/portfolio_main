<h2>CakeAHolics By Claire</h2>
<span><em>A website design for a potential client</em></span>

<h3>Reasons for this project</h3>
<p>A client has asked me to develop a website for their business to help them promote themselves in the area and help them to reach new customers to develop and expand their business.</p>

<h3>Specifications and Requirements</h3>
<p>The client wanted a simple website design, where clients can see basic information, such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A simple landing page</li>
    <li>A simple overview of their products</li>
    <li>Contact</li>
    <li>About</li>
</ul>
<p>The client also wanted their social media integrated into the footer of the website, so users can see the latest news and updates</p>


<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, after a small time developing this project, the client decided to leave creating a website for their business. I enjoyed this project as being a being a little different than due to communicating with a clients their own needs and requirements for their business. The client was happy for me to use the initial start of the design to use on my portfolio</p>

<h2>Code Academy</h2>
<span><em>A copy of the landing page CodeAcademy uses</em></span>

<h3>Reasons for this project</h3>
<p>This project is for the HTML and CSS technical training for the Software Development Bootcamp from JustIT.</p>

<h3>Specifications and Requirements</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Selection of website</li>
    <li>Analysis and planning</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Structure and design</li>
        <li>Styling</li>
        <li>Developer tools</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Development</li>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Focus on Design</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>This project has been a challenge and have taught me to learn, revise and expenses my knowledge in certain areas of CSS, such as media queries. So, there is still some work to be made before it can be close to the one CodeAcademy employs on their landing page. It has been a challenging task to develop, but it has helped me to review weaker areas and grow and expand them. I really had fun with this task.

<h2>Quiz</h2>
<span><em>A simple quiz game in Python</em></span>

<h3>Reasons for this project</h3>
<p>This project is for the Python technical training for the Software Development Bootcamp from JustIT.</p>

<h3>Specifications and Requirements</h3>
<p>These are our requirements for the Python Task </p>
<ol>
    <li>Welcome Message</li>
    <li>Display Questions</li>
    <li>User Input/li>
    <li>Calculate Score</li>
    <li>Display Results</li>
    <li>Data Validation</li>
    <li>Thank you message </li>
</ol>

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>All error handling is well documented within my GitHub link.</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>Out of the four tasks that were set by JustIT in the Python technical training classes, this for me has to be the most fun one I developed. Everything about this script, I am truly happy with. The quiz itself is dynamic, creating a quiz from the template.json (github) and adding it to the 'quizzes/' directory allow for more quizzes to be played and scoring is all done dynamically as well, no matter on the amount of questions, the scoring system is still the same.</p>

    <h2>Name</h2>

    <span><em>A simple tasks app using vanilla JavaScript</em></span>

    <h3>Reason for project</h3>
    <p>I created this task as a challenge myself to change Document Object Models (DOM) using JavaScript. I thought a tasks app would be a really good example. Through this and using JavaScript, manipulating the webpage by adding tasks, renaming them, completing them or change a completed task back to a pending state. I thought this would be a really good task.</p>

    <h3>Specifications and Features</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Add a new task</li>
        <li>Counter for pending items</li>
        <li>Counter for completed items</li>
        <li>Pending tasks</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete a task - click on the cross icon</li>
            <li>Rename</li>
            <li>Delete</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Completed Tasks</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Move back to pending - click on the cross</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Error Handing</h3>
    <span>Two elements have error control</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Adding a task</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Error message when empty</li>
            <li>Alerts the user</li>
            <li>Red border around the input element</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Renaming a task</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Error when the renamed task is empty</li>
            <li>Red border around the input element to display where the error is coming from</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outcomes</h3>
    <p>I am really happy with how this task has turned out and how through the task itself, there are controls to prevent errors occurring as well as letting the user know there has been an error (empty input etc.). Additionally, this task has really helped me to have a solid grasp and knowledge on the basic fundamentals and some advanced concepts for how to manipulating DOM elements on a webpage using JavaScript.</p>
